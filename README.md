# Next Firebase Auth Project

`Email and Password Demo: `
https://next-firebase-auth-red.vercel.app/

This project was developed with `NextJS` for the frontend and `Firebase` for the Backend.

I started this project to practice more with `NextJs`, its built in router and to learn about authenticating users.

Authentication was initially done with `email and password`.
