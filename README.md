# Next Firebase Auth Project

This project was developed with `NextJS` for the frontend and `Firebase` for the Backend.


I started this project to practice more with `NextJs`, its built in router and to learn about authenticating users.


Authentication was initially done with `email and password`.

First Live Demo will represent this version.

In upcoming updates, I will be forking this branch to develop a version with `google authentication`.


`Demo will be deployed on vercel once the project has functionality developed`
